## Description

__About:__ This dataset consists of Python objects in pkl format, which were generated by executing qMRLab scripts in MATLAB, and they are utilized to produce interactive visualizations with Plotly. The outputs are derived from Bloch simulations of qMRI experiments and incorporate a select number of in-vivo datasets. These outputs serve to illustrate the connection between quantitative images and their corresponding qualitative counterparts from which they were derived.<br /><br />Dataset provided for NeuroLibre preprint.
